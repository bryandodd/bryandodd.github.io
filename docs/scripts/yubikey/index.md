# Yubikey Setup & Configuration

!!! info "Annotations"

     Annotations are used throughout some of the examples below. Clicking the <span style="color: yellow">:octicons-feed-plus-16:{ title="annotation icon" }</span> symbols reveals additional comments intended for clarity.

## Requirements

There are a few prerequisites you'll need to setup before continuing on to setup your key(s). The information on this page assumes you've already installed `gnupg` and initialized your local keyring.

    [:simple-homebrew: pinentry-mac](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pinentry-mac)
    
    `brew install pinentry-mac`
### `pinentry-mac`

If you'll be using PINs with your Yubikey (and I strongly recommend you do), you'll want some method of entering them other than strictly through terminal. The default tool for working with Yubikey is `pinentry-curses` -- but a gui version is available through `pinentry-mac`.

```bash
$ brew install pinentry-mac

==> Fetching pinentry-mac
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Pouring pinentry-mac--1.1.1.1.arm64_ventura.bottle.tar.gz

==> Caveats
You can now set this as your pinentry program like

~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
    pinentry-program /opt/homebrew/bin/pinentry-mac

==> Summary
üç∫  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/pinentry-mac/1.1.1.1: 19 files, 518.7KB
```

To complete the installation, we'll need to set `pinentry-mac` as the default tool. First, confirm the precise location by running command `where pinentry-mac` from the terminal.  Assuming the answer is the same default location as specified by the Homebrew output above:
```bash
# open (or create if it doesn't exist) ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
# and add the following line:
pinentry-program /opt/homebrew/bin/pinentry-mac
# save and close gpg-agent.conf

# reload the gpg-agent with the following command:
$ gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye
```

### `yubikey-manager` (`ykman`)

Yubikey Manager is a CLI tool for configuring your Yubikey device: FIDO2, OTP, PIV, identify serial and firmware, enable or disable interfaces, and other extended features of Yubikey devices. This is the tool I use most frequently when interacting with my device.

See also: [`ykman` CLI Documentation](https://docs.yubico.com/software/yubikey/tools/ykman/Using_the_ykman_CLI.html)

``` bash
$ ykman --help

Usage: ykman [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Configure your YubiKey via the command line.

  Examples:

    List connected YubiKeys, only output serial number:
    $ ykman list --serials

    Show information about YubiKey with serial number 123456:
    $ ykman --device 123456 info

Options:
  -d, --device SERIAL             specify which YubiKey to interact with by serial number
  -r, --reader NAME               specify a YubiKey by smart card reader name (can't be used with --device or list)
  -t, --scp-ca FILENAME           specify the CA to use to verify the SCP11 card key (CA-KLCC)
  -s, --scp CRED                  specify private key and certificate chain for secure messaging, can be used multiple times to provide key and certificates in multiple files (private key,
                                  certificates in leaf-last order), OR SCP03 keys in hex  separated by colon (:) K-ENC:K-MAC[:K-DEK]

  --log-file FILE                 write log to FILE instead of printing to stderr (requires --log-level)
  --diagnose                      show diagnostics information useful for troubleshooting
  -v, --version                   show version information about the app

## Working With Multiple Keys

It's always recommended to have at least one spare Yubikey to configure at the same time you sit down to configure your first key. What you don't want to happen is to spend a few hours getting your key configured just how you want it, but then decide after-the-fact that you should have purchased a spare.  When that spare arrives, it will be frustrating to try to get that second key configured exactly as you did the first key unless you wrote everything down and saved all of the passcodes, pins, etc. in your password manager. 

Worse, if you've only setup a single key and then lose it, you're going to have to spend potentially hours going through all of your sites and services to remove your old key, setup a new one, or add alternative / backup authentication methods. 

When you do begin to work with multiple keys, you can connect each of them to your computer to setup simultaneously without having to constantly connect-disconnect-reconnect your keys a hundred times. The solution to this is noting the Serial Numbers for each of your keys.

!!! success "Setup Order"

    For GnuPG operations, you'll need to work on a single connected Yubikey at a time. For this reason, I always start with the OpenGPG configuration of each Yubikey first before moving on to the rest of the function setups (which can handle all cards being connected at once).


``` bash
# multiple keys connected
$ ykman info 

ERROR: Multiple YubiKeys detected. Use --device SERIAL to specify which one to use.


# identify all of the keys that are connected
$ ykman list

YubiKey 5C NFC (5.7.1) [OTP+FIDO+CCID] Serial: 12121212
YubiKey 5C Nano (5.7.1) [OTP+FIDO+CCID] Serial: 31313131
YubiKey 5C Nano (5.7.1) [OTP+FIDO+CCID] Serial: 32323232
YubiKey 5C NFC (5.7.1) [OTP+FIDO+CCID] Serial: 13131313
```

To specify a device, `--device 123456` must always come immediately after invocation of the CLI tool:

``` bash
$ ykman --device 12121212 info
